PROBLEM 1

1. when running ls -al *, it outputs all the files in the current directory.
   So, * matches all the files in the current directory.

2. When running ls -al .*, it outputs everything under the beginning
   directory. Because we put the . before the *, it outputs everything under
   the main directory (documents) and its subsequent directories.

3. You should never run the commands states in number 3 because it will
   delete everything under your main directory (it will delete a lot of stuff)

 
PROBLEM 2

1. to sort a listing by file modification time, use ls -lt -c

2. To show number lines when using cat, use cat -n <filename>

3. displays one-line manual page descriptions    

PROBLEM 3

1. file.txt only contains the word apple

2. file.txt now only contains the word banana. The > function will insert
   whatever text you want, but it will override what is currently in the
   specific file

3. file.txt now contains banana and carrot. That means that >> will insert
   text, but it will not override what is currently in the file

4. | takes output and outputs it through another program. In this case, it
   took a c b e d g f and outputed it through wc which then converted it
   to other numbers
